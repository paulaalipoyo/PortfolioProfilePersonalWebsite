                    <h3>Who am I and who do I want to become?</h3>
                    <p> Hello, I am Paula Bianca C. Alipoyo , and I am an outdoor enthusiast and adrenaline junkie who loves traveling to new places. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to explore some of the most stunning locations around the Philippines, and my passion for adventure has taken me to new heights, both literally and figuratively. In fact, I am proud to say that I have climbed the top 5 highest mountains in the Philippines. </p> <br>
                    <p> My adventures have taught me the value of perseverance, determination, and hard work. Climbing a mountain is not easy, and it requires a great deal of physical and mental strength. However, the rewards of reaching the summit are indescribable. The feeling of standing on top of a mountain and looking out at the world below is something that cannot be replicated.</p> <br>
                    <p> My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good sense of humor. As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate friendship and people who surround me.</p> <br>
                    <p>I am one of those individuals who want to become a successful person in relation to the IT industry. At the same time, I have a deep desire to explore the world and travel to different countries and experience their unique cultures. </p> <br>
                    <p>I have a strong desire to explore the world and experience different cultures. I believe that traveling can broaden one's horizons, help them develop a better understanding of the world, and open up new opportunities. Therefore, I have been planning to take breaks in between my academic pursuits and professional career to travel to different parts of the world. I want to explore the diverse landscapes, sample the local cuisine, and immerse myself in the local culture. I believe that traveling can be a great way to recharge my batteries and gain new perspectives that can be valuable in both my personal and professional life. </p>

                    <h3>Which skills do I possess? </h3>
                    <p> I have developed a range of skills that are essential for success in this field. One set of skills that I possess is administrative skills, which are important in IT for organizing, planning, and managing tasks and projects effectively. While I am not an expert in administrative skills, I have developed a foundation of knowledge and experience that allows me to be an effective contributor to IT projects. some of the administrative skills that I possess in IT, despite not being an expert. </p> <br>
                    <p> I have a strong understanding of organizational skills, which enable me to manage tasks and projects effectively. I can prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance, and I can ensure that deadlines are met. I can create to-do lists and project plans that help me to stay on track and manage my time effectively. Additionally, I can create and maintain filing systems, which allow me to retrieve information quickly and easily. </p> <br>
                    <p> I possess planning skills. While I may not be an expert in this area, I can develop project plans that are comprehensive, realistic, and achievable. I can identify the goals and objectives of a project, develop timelines, and allocate resources accordingly. I can also create contingency plans and identify potential risks.</p> <br>

                <div class="section-title">
                    <h3>Whom do I want to surround myself with? </h3>
                    <p>I value positive energy, minimal drama, and a passion for travel. These are the qualities that I seek in the people I surround myself with, and I believe that doing so has a profound impact on my life.</p> <br>
                    <p>When I surround myself with positive people, I find that I am more likely to feel happy, motivated, and inspired. This, in turn, leads to a greater sense of well-being and a more positive outlook on life.</p> <br>
                    <p>Surrounding oneself with drama-free people can reduce stress and anxiety. Drama tends to be a drain on one's emotional energy, and can be exhausting to deal with. When I surround myself with people who avoid drama and negativity, I find that my life is more peaceful and calm. I am able to focus on my own goals and interests without being pulled down by other people's problems.</p> <br>
                    <p>Surrounding oneself with people who share a love of travel can be incredibly rewarding. Travel is one of the most enriching and transformative experiences a person can have, and having friends who share this passion can lead to unforgettable adventures and memories. When I travel with like-minded people, I find that I am able to experience new places and cultures in a more meaningful way. I am also able to learn from my travel companions and gain new perspectives on the world.</p> <br>
                    <p>I believe that it's important to surround oneself with positive people who share similar interests and values. By doing so, we can improve our mood and mental health, reduce stress and drama, and have more fulfilling experiences. While it may not always be easy to find these types of people, it's important to make an effort to seek out those who share our passions and outlook on life. By doing so, we can create a supportive and positive community around ourselves, and live happier, more fulfilling lives.</p>

                    <h3> Which companies do I want to work for?</h3>
                    <p>I want to work for an IT company that offers remote work, and how it will allow me to spend more time with my family.</p> <br>
                    <p>Working remotely offers me the flexibility to manage my work and personal life more effectively. When I am working from home or remotely, I can better balance my time between work and family. This is especially important to me as a family person who values spending quality time with my loved ones.</p> <br>
                    <p>Working remotely saves me time and money on commuting to the workplace. When I work remotely, I don't have to spend time traveling to and from the office, which can be both stressful and tiring. Instead, I can use that time to do things that matter to me, like spending time with my family, pursuing hobbies or personal interests, or simply taking a break to relax and recharge.remote work allows me to work in a comfortable and familiar environment.

                    <h3> What type of job do I want to do?</h3>
                    <p>As someone who is interested in pursuing a career in the IT industry but is not an expert in coding, I have thought a lot about what type of job would be a good fit for me. While coding is an essential skill for many IT jobs, there are still plenty of opportunities for people like me who have different skill sets and interests. In this essay, I will explore some of the job options available to me in the IT industry.</p> <br>
                    <p>One area of the IT industry that I am particularly interested in is project management. A project manager oversees the planning, implementation, and tracking of a project. They work with various stakeholders, including clients, team members, and vendors, to ensure that a project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the client's requirements. While project managers need to have a basic understanding of technical concepts, they do not need to be experts in coding. Instead, they need strong communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills. Another job option that interests me is business analysis.</p> <br>
                    <p>Business analysts work with stakeholders to identify business problems and opportunities and propose solutions that meet the organization's goals. They use data analysis, critical thinking, and communication skills to identify gaps in the existing business process, evaluate the impact of potential changes, and recommend solutions. While business analysts may need to work with technical teams, they do not necessarily need to have coding skills. Instead, they need a solid understanding of business principles and the ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders.</p> <br>
                    <p>Another job that does not require expert coding skills is technical writing. Technical writers create documentation for software applications, user manuals, and other technical materials. They work closely with software developers, project managers, and other stakeholders to understand technical concepts and translate them into user-friendly language. While technical writers may need a basic understanding of coding concepts, they primarily need strong writing and communication skills.</p> <br>
                    <p>Finally, another job that interests me is technical sales. Technical sales professionals sell IT products and services to businesses and other organizations. They work closely with customers to understand their needs and recommend solutions that meet those needs. While technical sales professionals need to have a basic understanding of technical concepts, they do not need to be experts in coding. Instead, they need strong communication, networking, and negotiation skills.</p> <br>
                    <p>In conclusion, as someone who is interested in pursuing a career in the IT industry but not an expert in coding, there are many job options available to me. Project management, business analysis, technical writing, and technical sales are just a few examples of jobs that do not require expert coding skills but still offer exciting opportunities to work in the IT industry. By exploring these options, I can find a job that fits my interests, skills, and career goals.</p>
